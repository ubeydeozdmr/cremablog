## 2023 August update: After a long time

It's been a long time since I developed the project and I plan to write it from scratch instead of going over the old version. If you still want to restore it, you can take a look at the [10-10-2023-discontinued](https://github.com/ubeydeozdmr/cremablog/tree/10-10-2022-discontinued) branch and you can read the [README.md](https://github.com/ubeydeozdmr/cremablog/blob/10-10-2022-discontinued/README.md) of that branch. Until the project is rewritten and published at https://cremablog.cyclic.app, you can see the undeveloped version of the site from this link.
